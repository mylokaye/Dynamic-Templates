# Dynamics 365 Customer Insights Journeys: A collection of templates for Dynamics 365 Forms, Preference Centers and Emails

These fully customizable, WCAG-compliant templates give you **complete control over branding, layout, and user experience.**

---

## ⚠️ The Challenge

The default setup for editing forms, emails and pages in Dynamics 365 is rigid and visually outdated. 

Brand customization in Forms and Preference Centers is difficult if you don't know much HTML, and even when making small changes, the results are inconsistent and can quickly become a visual nightmare.

---

## 💡 The Solution

This project rebuilds the Dynamics 365 forms and preference centers **from the ground up**, using clean HTML5, accessible markup, and fully documented JavaScript.  
It provides a **drop-in, production-ready template** that gives you:

- Accessible, WCAG-compliant with indications for incorrect and correctly filled fields
- Responsive design with light and dark mode compatibility
