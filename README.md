# Dynamics 365 Customer Insights Journeys: Customized Form

A **dynamic HTML template** that lets you build your own branded, modern Form in **Dynamics 365 Customer Insights – Journeys**.

Deliver an excellent experience for your customers and contacts while empowering them to manage their consent.  
This fully customizable, WCAG-compliant form template gives you **complete control over branding, layout, and user experience.**

---

## ⚠️ The Challenge

The default form setup in Dynamics 365 is rigid and visually outdated.  
Brand customization is minimal, accessibility support is limited, and modifying layout or logic often breaks the form.  
This results in an inconsistent customer experience that doesn’t reflect your brand standards or modern UX expectations.

## 💡 The Solution

This project rebuilds the Dynamics 365 form **from the ground up**, using clean HTML5, accessible markup, and fully documented JavaScript.  
It provides a **drop-in, production-ready template** that gives you:

- Email field validation to improve data quality
- Accessible, WCAG-compliant with indications for incorrect and correctly filled fields
- Responsive design with light and dark mode compatibility
