**Email Validation Enhancements
**

Added intelligent domain typo detection with auto-suggestions (e.g., "gmial.com" â†’ "Did you mean gmail.com?")

Implemented disposable email blocking for 11+ temporary email providers (mailinator, tempmail, guerrillamail, etc.)

Added RFC 5321 email length validation (254 character maximum)

Implemented TLD validation to ensure proper domain extensions (minimum 2 characters)

Added pattern validation to prevent leading/trailing dots, consecutive dots, and invalid characters

Keyboard accessibility: Press Enter or Tab to auto-accept suggested email corrections

**Form Validation System
**
Created modular validation system with three specialized validators: NameValidator, EmailValidator, and MessageValidator

Implemented progressive error display: errors only appear after user leaves field (blur event), not while typing

Added real-time form state tracking with dynamic button enable/disable based on all fields' validity

Name fields require 2+ characters and only accept letters, spaces, hyphens, and apostrophes

Message field requires 3-2000 characters with internal validation (no visible character counter)
